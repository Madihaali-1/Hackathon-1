# Research: Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Decision: Module Structure and Content Organization
**Rationale**: Following the existing pattern established by Modules 1-3 in the Docusaurus documentation structure, with 4 files per module (3 chapters + summary) and proper category configuration.
**Alternatives considered**: Alternative structures like single comprehensive file or different numbering schemes were rejected to maintain consistency with existing modules.

## Decision: Technology Stack for Documentation
**Rationale**: Using Markdown files with Docusaurus-specific frontmatter for proper integration with the existing documentation system. This ensures consistency with the existing tech stack and navigation.
**Alternatives considered**: Other documentation formats like reStructuredText or AsciiDoc were rejected to maintain compatibility with the existing Docusaurus setup.

## Decision: Content Depth and Examples
**Rationale**: Providing practical examples with code snippets in each chapter to ensure users can implement the concepts after reading. This aligns with the educational goals specified in the user scenarios.
**Alternatives considered**: Theoretical-only content was rejected as it wouldn't meet the requirement for practical implementation examples.

## Decision: Integration with Existing System
**Rationale**: Using the same directory structure, naming conventions, and configuration patterns as existing modules (Modules 1-3) to ensure seamless integration with the Docusaurus site.
**Alternatives considered**: Different directory structures were rejected to maintain consistency and avoid breaking the existing navigation system.
