# Introduction

This module covers the creation and use of digital twins for humanoid robotics using Gazebo and Unity simulation environments. You'll learn about physics-based simulation, high-fidelity digital twins, and sensor simulation techniques.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Set up physics-based simulations in Gazebo for humanoid robots
- Create high-fidelity digital twins using Unity
- Simulate various sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMU) in both environments
- Validate sensor outputs and simulation results

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with ROS 2 (covered in Module 1)
- Basic knowledge of simulation environments

## Chapters

This module is organized into three chapters:

1. **Physics Simulation with Gazebo** - Learn to create realistic physics-based simulations
2. **Digital Twins & HRI in Unity** - Create high-fidelity visual representations
3. **Sensor Simulation & Validation** - Simulate and validate various sensor types

## Summary

After completing all chapters, review the [Summary and Next Steps](./summary) to consolidate your learning and explore advanced topics.
