# Introduction to Gazebo for Physics Simulation

Gazebo is a powerful physics-based simulation environment that allows you to test and validate robotic algorithms in realistic virtual worlds. This chapter will guide you through setting up physics-based simulations for humanoid robots with accurate dynamics.

## What is Gazebo?

Gazebo is a 3D simulation environment that provides:
- Realistic physics simulation using ODE, Bullet, or Simbody engines
- High-quality graphics rendering
- Multiple sensors support (LiDAR, cameras, IMU, etc.)
- Plugins framework for custom functionality
- Integration with ROS/ROS 2

## Why Use Gazebo for Humanoid Robotics?

Humanoid robots present unique challenges that make simulation particularly valuable:
- Complex multi-body dynamics with many degrees of freedom
- Balance and locomotion control
- Human-like interaction with environments
- Safety considerations during development

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- Understand Gazebo's architecture and components
- Set up simulation environments with realistic physics
- Configure humanoid robot models for simulation
- Run physics-based simulations and analyze results

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have:
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with ROS 2 (covered in Module 1)
- Basic knowledge of robot modeling (URDF/SDF format)
