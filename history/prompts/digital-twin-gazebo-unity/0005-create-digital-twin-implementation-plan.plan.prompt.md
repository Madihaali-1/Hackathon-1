## Prompt

-Set up Module-2 in Docusaurus with structured chapters for Gazebo & Unity simulations (physics, environments, sensors).

-All content written as .nd files, organized per chapter for easy navigation.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) including technical context, research findings, data model, and quickstart guide.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully created complete implementation plan with all required artifacts
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, and contracts directory
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks to generate implementation tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan addresses all aspects of documentation module implementation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
