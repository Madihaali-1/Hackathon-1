## Prompt

Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Target audience:
-AI and robotics students building simulated humanoid environments

Focus:
-Physics-based simulation with Gazebo
-High-fidelity digital twins and HRI using Unity
-Sensor simulation (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMU)

Structure (Docusaurus):
-Chapter 1: Physics Simulation with Gazebo -Chapter 2: Digital Twins & HRI in Unity
-Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation & Validation
-Tech: Docusaurus (all files in.md)

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) including user stories, functional requirements, success criteria, and quality checklist.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully created complete specification for digital twin simulation module
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements.md checklist files
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan to create implementation plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification addresses all three focus areas with clear user scenarios.
