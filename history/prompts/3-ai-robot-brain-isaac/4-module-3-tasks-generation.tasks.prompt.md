# Prompt History Record: Module 3 Tasks Generation - NVIDIA Isaac Documentation

## Original Prompt

```
sp.tasks Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
```

## Response Summary

Successfully generated comprehensive implementation tasks for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™). The tasks document includes:

1. **Phase 1: Documentation Implementation** - Tasks for creating three Docusaurus chapters covering Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 for humanoid robotics.

2. **Phase 2: Docusaurus Integration** - Tasks for setting up module structure and integrating with the Docusaurus sidebar.

3. **Phase 3: Content Validation** - Tasks for validating technical accuracy and verifying learning objectives.

4. **Phase 4: Quality Assurance** - Tasks for content review and Docusaurus build testing.

The tasks are organized by user story priority (P1, P2, P3) as defined in the feature specification:
- US1: Isaac Sim for simulation and synthetic data generation
- US2: Isaac ROS for perception and navigation
- US3: Nav2 for humanoid path planning

Each task includes status, owner, effort estimate, test criteria, acceptance criteria, and implementation steps. The document also includes dependencies, out-of-scope items, and risk mitigation strategies.
