## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully created the implementation plan for Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA). The planning phase included:

1. Created implementation plan (plan.md) with technical context and project structure
2. Completed research phase (research.md) with decisions on module structure, technology stack, content depth, and integration approach
3. Created data model (data-model.md) defining the entities and relationships for the VLA module
4. Developed quickstart guide (quickstart.md) for users to get started with the module
5. Created API contract (contracts/vla-module-api.yaml) for potential interactive elements

All required artifacts for the planning phase have been generated and follow the established patterns from the project constitution. The plan aligns with the feature specification and maintains consistency with the existing Docusaurus documentation structure.

## OUTCOME

Planning phase completed successfully. All required artifacts created and aligned with project constitution. Ready for task generation phase (/sp.tasks).
