  Successfully implemented Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) documentation in the my-frontend folder. The implementation includes:

  1. Complete documentation structure with 4 chapters:
     - Voice-to-Action using OpenAI Whisper
     - Cognitive Planning with LLMs for ROS 2 Actions
     - Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid
     - Summary page

  2. All tasks from tasks.md have been completed and marked as done:
     - Phase 1: Setup Tasks (4/4 completed)
     - Phase 2: Foundational Tasks (5/5 completed)
     - Phase 3: VLA Module Documentation Setup (6/6 completed)
     - Phase 4: Voice-to-Action Chapter Implementation (8/8 completed)
     - Phase 5: Cognitive Planning with LLMs Chapter Implementation (9/9 completed)
     - Phase 6: Capstone Project Documentation Implementation (9/9 completed)
     - Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (12/12 completed)

  3. All documentation files include:
     - Comprehensive content with practical examples
     - Code snippets and implementation details
     - Proper frontmatter with sidebar positioning
     - Cross-references and navigation structure

  4. The Docusaurus site will automatically include the new module in the sidebar due to the autogenerated structure.
outcome: "VLA module documentation successfully implemented with all required content and proper integration into the Docusaurus site structure."
evaluation: "All acceptance criteria from the user stories have been satisfied, with comprehensive documentation covering voice-to-action systems, cognitive planning with LLMs, and the capstone autonomous humanoid project."

## Implementation Details

The VLA module provides comprehensive coverage of integrated AI and robotics systems with three interconnected components:

1. **Voice-to-Action using OpenAI Whisper**: Documentation on implementing speech recognition systems and mapping voice commands to robotic actions
2. **Cognitive Planning with LLMs for ROS 2 Actions**: Coverage of how Large Language Models can be used for high-level planning and integration with ROS 2 action servers
3. **Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid**: A comprehensive project applying all concepts in an integrated system

The documentation includes practical examples, code snippets, and proper navigation structure that integrates seamlessly with the existing Docusaurus site.
